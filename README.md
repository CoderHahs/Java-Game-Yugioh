# Java-Game-Yugioh

Hi! Welcome to the game called Yugioh created by Hrithik Shah in 2016. This is a simplified version of the Yugioh card game. I
made this to explore my capabilities using Java.

In this repository, the lone folder is what you need to download, to be able to play the game.

The best way to play the game is to run it on a Java compiler like Dr. Java (mac) or Ready to Java (windows), 
or something similar.

Just open up YUGIOH.java, compile and run it!

Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy the game.
